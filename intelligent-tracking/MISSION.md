# Mission Statement

Build an intelligent location tracking software that does not rely on external GPS hardware, but instead uses digital identifiers (IP address, IMEI, phone number, device specs) in combination with telecom infrastructure, network forensics, and geospatial agents (like satellites and base stations) to determine and predict a device‚Äôs real-time and historical location.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Features to Build

### üîç Identifier-Based Tracking
- Accept inputs like IP Address, IMEI, Phone Number, SIM ICCID, and coordinates
- Query public and proprietary databases for historical movements and registration zones

### üõ∞Ô∏è Triangulation Engine
- Integrate with WCDMA/CDMA/LTE networks to request base station handoff data
- Use Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) and Angle of Arrival (AoA) algorithms for precision

### Satellite & Telecom Integration
- Access satellite imagery APIs + LTE base tower maps
- Interface with telecom providers or data brokers for cell tower pings and metadata correlation

### üß™ Mobile Forensics Connector
- Extract location logs, cached Wi-Fi data, mobile network info from confiscated devices
- Decode raw data using forensic parsers, then visualize movements

### üìä Real-Time Dashboard
- Map visualization with live tracking, historical playback, anomaly detection
- Geo-fencing alerts and predictive routing (based on behavioral learning)

## 4. Security & Compliance
- Implement TLS 1.3, role-based access, audit trails
- Ensure legal alignment with jurisdiction‚Äôs surveillance laws

## 5. AI Enhancements
- Train behavior prediction models (e.g. destination forecasting)
- Use anomaly detection for spoofed or masked activity

## 6. Testing
- Run location trace simulations
- Verify API accuracy vs known ground-truth coordinates

## 7. Deployment

### Bonus Innovation Ideas
- Displacement Alerts: Notify sudden location jumps (possible spoof or escape)
- Offline Footprint Detection: Use cached tower data to retrace offline movements
- Cross-Device Linking: Associate multiple identifiers to one user entity
